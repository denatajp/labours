# Introduction

Labours is a web-based application design that provides information services on odd jobs around the user. This application was created as an intermediary between job seekers and job owners. 

The idea of making this application is similar to other existing job applications such as Jobstreet. However, Labors is a simplified version of the other web, because the jobs provided are home-based jobs, not jobs that require CVs, work experience, and interviews. This application is expected to be a platform for people who want to find side jobs, as well as people who want to ask someone to help them complete a job.
